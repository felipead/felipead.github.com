  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

  <p>I am a seasoned software engineer and agnostic technologist, who has been
    developing <span class="buzzword">distributed systems</span> and
    cloud applications for over 16 years. Although I am more focused on building
    scalable, resilient, and self-contained backend services (aka.
    <span class="buzzword">microservices</span>), I collaborate and have a
    hands-on over the entire stack.
