<h2>Aspiring Developer Jedi</h2>

<p>I'm a polyglot full-stack developer and I consider myself technology agnostic. I solve problems
without being constrained by a particular language or platform. Along my career I delivered 
mission-critical software with a devotion to quality. To me, quality means writing clean and 
maintainable code that reliably solves the business problem at hand, with minimum effort.</p>

<p>I believe that Lean and Agile practices such as collaborative teamwork, short release and 
feedback cycles, test driven development and infrastructure automation can be decisive for success.
I'm also a big fan of the Conway's law.</p>

<p>I work for ThoughtWorks.</p>
