  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>

  <p>I am a seasoned Software Engineer, Computer Science graduate and
  Open-Source contributor with more than 12 years developing web applications
  and solving non-trivial problems in a varied range of technologies, from
  which the most notable are
  <span class="buzzword">Java</span>,
  <span class="buzzword">Python</span> and
  <span class="buzzword">Ruby</span>.
  </p>

  <p>I currently work developing the backend services that automate operations
  at <a href="http://toptal.com">Toptal</a>, an innovative marketplace that
  connects clients to the top 3% of global talents. Before that, I worked at
  <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, the industry leader when
  it comes to Agile and Lean software delivery, consulting for Fortune 500
  clients from several industries.

  <p>I am truly passionate about solving challenging problems related to
  <span class="buzzword">distributed systems</span> and
  <span class="buzzword">data engineering</span>.
  I am also often seen trying to convince my clients and colleagues about
  <span class="buzzword">test-driven development</span>,
  <span class="buzzword">infrastructure as code</span>,
  <span class="buzzword">Lean software delivery</span> and
  <span class="buzzword">API design</span> best-practices.
