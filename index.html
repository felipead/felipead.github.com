<h2>Technology Agnostic Software Engineer</h2>

<p>I'm a polyglot full-stack developer and I consider myself technology agnostic. I solve problems without being constrained by the limitations of a particular language or platform. Along my career I delivered mission-critical software with a religious devotion to quality. To me, quality means writing clean and maintainable code that solves the business problem at hand reliably and with minimum effort.</p>

<p>I believe that Lean and Agile practices such as collaborative teamwork, small iterations, automated testing, short release cycles and infrastructure automation can be decisive for success. I'm also a big fan of the Conway's law!</p>

<p>I work at <a href="http://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>.</p>
