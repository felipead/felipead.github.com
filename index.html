<h2>Aspiring Developer Jedi</h2>

<p>I like to think of myself as technology agnostic. That means I try to solve software engineering problems without being constrained by the limitations of a particular language or platform. Along a 10+ year career I delivered mission-critical software with a religious devotion to quality. To me quality means not only producing clean, readable and maintainable code, but code that reliably solves the problem at hand. Yes, I believe automated tests and continuous delivery do matter. I'm also a team player!</p>

<p>Specialities: <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>REST APIs</strong>, <strong>NoSQL Databases</strong>, <strong>TDD</strong>.</p>

<p>Interests: <em>Go</em>, <em>iOS</em>, <em>Microservices</em>, <em>Big Data</em>, <em>Data Science</em>, <em>DevOps</em>, <em>Continuous Delivery</em>, <em>Computer Vision</em>...</p>
