<h2>Aspiring Jedi Developer</h2>

<p>I like to think of myself as technology agnostic. That means I try to solve software engineering problems without being constrained by the limitations of a particular language or platform. Along a 10+ year career I delivered mission-critical software with a religious devotion to quality. To me quality means not only producing clean, readable and maintainable code, but also delivering code that solves problems and is covered by automated tests.</p>

<p>Specialities: <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>REST APIs</strong>, <strong>NoSQL</strong>, <strong>TDD</strong>.</p>

<p>Interests: <em>Microservices</em>, <em>Data Engineering</em>, <em>Data Science</em>, <em>Analytics</em>, <em>Machine Learning</em>, <em>DevOps</em>, <em>Provisioning</em>, <em>Continuous Delivery</em>, <em>Computer Vision</em>, <em>Mobile Apps</em> ...</p>

<p>Programming is one of my hobbies and I develop <em>Open Source Software</em> in my free time. Take a look at my <a href="{{ site.github_url }}">GitHub</a>.</p>
