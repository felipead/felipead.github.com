<h2>Senior Software Engineer</h2>
<p>
I like to think of myself as technology agnostic. Even though I have been working for more than a decade in projects where <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C#</strong> stacks were the most dominant, I'm constantly researching and experimenting new technologies that best fit the task at hand.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently interested in <em>Microservices</em>, <em>Container-based Virtualization</em>, <em>NoSQL Databases</em>, <em>Data Science</em>, <em>Machine Learning</em> and <em>Computer Vision</em>. You can see some of my work and research at my <a href="{{ site.github_url }}">GitHub</a>.
