<h2>Aspiring Developer Jedi</h2>

<p>I'm a polyglot developer and agnostic technologist. That means I solve software engineering problems without being constrained by the limitations of a particular language or platform. Along a 10+ year career I delivered mission-critical software with a religious devotion to quality. To me quality means not only writing clean and maintainable code, but code that solves the problem at hand reliably and with minimum effort.</p>

<p>I believe that automated testing, continuous delivery, infrastructure automation and other Agile practices are not only important, but a decisive factor for success. I'm also an excellent collaborator and a team player.</p>

<p>Specialities: <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, <strong>Big Data</strong></p>

<p>Take a look at my <a href="{{ site.github_url }}">open-source projects</a> and <a href="{{ site.twitter_url }}">follow me</a> for technology insights.</p>
