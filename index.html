<h2>SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h2>

I see myself as technology agnostic. Although I have a decade of experience designing and developing software mostly based on Java, C#, Python, C++ and several Web technologies, I am constantly learning and trying out new languages and frameworks that best fit the task at hand. I have a solid background on Agile and Test Driven Development. Along my career I solved problems that were challenging at both size and complexity basing myself on a strong Computer Science foundation. I work closely with my team to deliver code that follows best practices, has automated tests and meets the business needs.
